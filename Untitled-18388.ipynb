    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Every five years, SAIL Amsterdam attracts millions of visitors to the city’s waterfront for one of the world’s largest tall ship events. The celebration showcases the Netherlands’ maritime heritage and historic fleets. A massive event like this poses significant logistical challenges: large, fluctuating and not easily predictable pedestrian flows must be managed without compromising safety or the functioning of surrounding transport systems. Therefore, anticipating where and when peaks occur is crucial for maintaining public safety and accessibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project investigates to what extent anomalous peaks in pedestrian flow can be predicted up to 15 minutes in advance using historical sensor data and temporal features. We develop and evaluate machine-learning approaches, such as XGBoost and Random Forest, to deliver short-horizon alerts of impending anomalies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The report documents the full pipeline, from data selection and preprocessing to model training and evaluation and assesses which method gives the most accurate and timely anomaly predictions. The findings aim to support a data-driven operational workflow for real-time crowd monitoring which coulf have been used during SAIL 2025, helping authorities optimize staffing, steer pedestrian routing and reduce overcrowding risk. The results will contribute to a more data-driven and resilient approach to crowd management for SAIL's next edition and similar large-scale public events."

    "All figures and graphs that are used in the report, are created based on the provided data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset exhibits a clear daily cycle, with sensors showing similar behaviour and peaks occurring at roughly the same times. Therefore, we made predictions combining multiple days for a more accurate prediction. Since the data per sensor was also behaving similarly, we filtered the data to only 3 sensors instead of 36 to give a clearer and better outline.\n",
    "\n",
    "At sensor 1: GVCV-13_10 (Buiksloterweg ferry terminal), large numbers of visitors cross between Amsterdam North and Central Station to reach waterfront viewing areas. This site acts as a key bottleneck, suitable for analysing queuing behaviour for ferry waiting, flow efficiency, and ferry capacity during peak event hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sensor 2: CMSA-GAKH-01_0 (the Kalverstraat) area represents Amsterdam’s main commercial street, where Sail visitors intersect with dense everyday shopping and touristic activity. This location enables the evaluation of sensor accuracy in crowded, mixed-use environments and offers insight into how large-scale events influence regular urban mobility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, sensor 3: CMSA-GAWW-12_295 (the Oudezijds Voorburgwal (Red Light District)) captures evening and leisure-related crowd dynamics, with fluctuating densities and narrow street layouts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these sites reflect transport, commercial, and recreational contexts, offering a representative foundation crowd flow prediction research during Sail 2025."

    "Graph 1 shows the average crowd flow per hour of the day and graph 2 displays the average crowd flow per day of the week. Both graphs display three sensors located in different areas of the SAIL event site, as explained in 'Data Used'. From the first graph, it becomes clear that the dataset exhibits a clear daily pattern, with flow levels rising sharply during late morning and afternoon hours and decreasing again in the evening. Although the absolute flow differs per location, the sensors show similar behaviour with peaks occurring at approximately the same times, indicating consistent crowd dynamics across the event area.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second graph illustrates the average crowd flow per weekday, showing that weekend days, particularly Saturday, experience the highest activity across all sensors. This confirms that visitor intensity increases toward the weekend. This pattern aligns with the expected visitor behaviour during large-scale events, where attendance typically builds up toward the weekend as more people are off work and able to attend leisure activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though the data period is limited to five days (the lenght of the SAIL event), these patterns suggest that both time of day and day of week are strong predictors of crowd intensity. Hence, temporal features such as hour and weekday are expected to contribute significantly to the model’s ability to forecast anomalous peaks in pedestrian flow.\n",

    "The figure above presents the detected pedestrian flow peaks for the Kalverstraat and Oudezijds Voorburgwal sensors during the five event days. Each subplot shows the measured flow at 3 minute resolution represented by a blue line. While the red dots indicate peak moments. The green arrows indicate valleys in flow count.\n",
    "\n",
    "The plots reveal several notable patterns. All sensors display a daily rhythm, with low activity during the morning hours and increasing pedestrian volumes throughout the afternoon and evening. The peaks occur around similar times on multiple days. Indicating recurring crowd flows, which may be linked to the scheduled events. Furthermore, the sensor at Kalverstraat consistently records higher and more freqeunt peaks than the sensor at Oudezijds Voorburgwal. This suggests that it is located at a more prominent location, experiencing heavier pedestrian volumes. This aligns with our predictions that the Kalverstraat may experience higher flow counts since it is also a place for shopping and regular tourism. The Oudezijdse Voorburgwal sensor shows more crowdflow in de late evening/early morning, which also aligns with expectations since its located in the heart of the Red Light District.\n",
    "\n",
    "The plots of the Kalverstraat show peaks in the early morning/late evening. This is caused by the rolling MAD method since the baseline is close to 0 since there is almost no crowdflow, resulting in peak detection even though these are not significant peaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite daily variations, the algorithm reliably identifies peaks. Showing that the method works well across different sensors and days apart from the early morning/late evening in the Kalverstraat.  Overall, this visualisation validates the rolling MAD (Median Absolute Deviation) approach for identifying peaks works good, confirming that the dataset captures meaningful pedestrian flow peaks suitable for predictive modeling."

    "This project explored the feasibility of how pedestrian flow can be predicted and detecting anomalous peaks at SAIL Amsterdam 2025. While using sensor data and applying machine learning models. The results provide a useful first step for high level crowd prediction. \n",
    "\n",
    "The daily and weekly movements patterns were captured, by analysing the historical data at the three different sensor locations. The crowd flows exhibit strong temporal patterns, which confirm that time of day and day of the week are key predictors for the activity of pedestrians. \n",
    "\n",
    "The model captured broad trends but struggled with fluctuations. It performed well predicting the general flow but failed to anticipate sudden and detailed peaks. This indicated that simple linear models are insufficient for accurate precise crowd flow forecasting. Suggesting the need for more advanced models such as XGBoost or LSTMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model could identify general high activity periods but was inconsistent in detecting anomalous peaks. Many sudden peaks were missed or underestimated. Therefore, while the model offers insights of potential busy moments it is not suitable for dependable crowd planning.\n",

    "The results provide a solid baseline for understanding and predicting broad pedestrian flow patterns. However, short term anomalous peak detection requires more data and more advanced modelling techniques to produce accurate results. Then it can be used to make real-time crowd-management decisions."
